Hi, iâ€™m hatninja. Although nowadays i'm better known as Smol Fofa.  
I program things i find interesting, and generally do well making small libraries and headless software in lua.

My biggest project is [AOLS2](https://github.com/hatninja/AOLS2), and i use it to host an Attorney Online server known as SBTV.

I'm always open to feedback and new ideas!
