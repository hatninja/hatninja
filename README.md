Hi, iâ€™m hatninja~ Although nowadays you may know me better as Smol Fofa.  
I program things i find interesting, and generally do well making small libraries and headless software in lua.

My biggest project is [AOLS2](https://github.com/hatninja/AOLS2), with it, i host an Attorney Online 2 server known as SBTV.

Thank you for looking at my page! I appreciate feedback.
